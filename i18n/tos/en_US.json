We will never use this information for any purpose other than to ascertain whether cheating is occuring within the demo recording. We will never use this information to attempt to ascertain personally identifiable information about any individual.\n        - To prevent your voice from being stored in the demo files, ensure the client convar \"voice_loopback\" is set to \"0\".\n    - Demo recordings also retain information that you may otherwise expect to not be visible, including but not limited to the alias, weapons, and items you were using at the time of recording.\n    - Demo recordings may be stored indefinitely, unless you exercise your right to forget.\n- Players you have marked as \"Cheater\" or \"Bot\" will be reported to the Masterbase.\n    - Reports of this nature will be transmitted when:\n        - You mark a player as a \"Cheater\" or \"Bot\".\n        - You encounter a player in-game that is presently marked by you as a \"Cheater\" or \"Bot\".\n    - This data may be used for research purposes, including but not limited to use as training or validation data in machine learning for the purposes of cheat detection.\n    - This data may be retained indefinitely, unless you exercise your right to forget.",
